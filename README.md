# bashRunners
A final group project in my Intro to Unix class in which a video game was developed to teach the player how to use Unix. 

Developed by: Brenna Holloway, Dallas DeSimone, Elijah Fraley, Kelsea Canaday

Narrative: You are starting as a cadet bash-runner at the Bash Runner Force, also known as the B.R.F. 
Your instructor and guide, L.A.R.K, will show you the ropes and teach you how to be a bash runner. 
Then, you will be sent out on missions to test your skills and climb up the ranks. Watch out for bash-criminals, though- they're lurking in the net.

Instructions: Download and extract all game files from the tgz tarball. Type "cd bashRunners" to get to 
the main directory, and then "./startGame.sh" to bring up the main menu. Enter a selection to begin the 
game. L.A.R.K. will give more instructions as the game progresses into each mission. If you ever need 
help, you can ask L.A.R.K. for assistance. 

Elements: 
Purpose – The purpose of bashRunners is to teach its players basic Unix skills. 
Constraints – The game is meant for its missions to be played in order. 
Conflict – The systems have been breached by multiple malicious sources, and the player needs 
to find 
Rewards – After the player gets a key, they are congratulated by the boss and L.A.R.K and 
encouraged to continue their missions. 
Chance – Given the chance that the player is confused on what to do next, they can ask L.A.R.K. 
for help. 
Growth – As the player finishes their missions, their skills in Unix will grow. 
Winner – The player wins when they have collected all six keys.
